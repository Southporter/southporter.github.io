## Getting on the (D)Bus

DBus is the defacto form of interprocess communication (IPC) for the Linux desktop. It is used by Gnome and KDE, the
two biggest players in the Linux desktop market.

Our first hurdle is to connect to one of the DBus busses. There are two kinds of connections: system and session. The system is more
for the key systems that run the operating system. This is mainly for things that interact with hardware or kernel.
The session bus handles software attached to your login session. These are usually programs that you launch your self or that your desktop needs to run.
