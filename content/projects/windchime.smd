Windchime is (going to be) a Linux desktop app that reminds me to take breaks. I often lose track of time while working
and need an automated remider to pause, breath, and look away from the screen. There are already several open source
break apps out there, but I have found them to be a bit obtrusive and bloated. Most of them are Electron apps. All of
them decide that they need to block your screen to force you to take a break.

My goal with this project is to make a lightweight, native application using the handmade ethos. This means starting from the basics to better
understand how the Linux desktop works. The end result should have:
- Notifications
- Gentle sounds
- Pause and skip options
- A settings window to tweak certain features
