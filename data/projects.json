			"RPG Map was an idea that my cousins and I came up with. I wanted to learn more about WebSockets, specifically socket-io, and Docker containers.",
			"The idea was to use Heroku to host the app, build it using a Docker container, and allow for live communication via WebSockets. I chose Python and Flask for the backend due to my familiarity with Python, but I wanted to explore other server frameworks, so I chose Flask because it seemed to have a good socket-io package.",
			"",
			"I learned a lot from this project. I don't think Python is the best for a docker container web server. Due to the need for packages, the size of the container gets larger and takes longer to spin up. I plan on redoing the backend in Go for a quicker startup."
