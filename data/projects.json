I am building the webpage, server, and mobile apps for the business.<br />For the website, I am using ReactJS as the view, Redux for the store, and the Django REST Framework for the backend.<br />As I do not have a Macintosh on which to work, I am currently only developing the mobile application for Android using AndroidStudio and Java.<br />While this is still a work in progress, I have learned a great deal about web development because of this project.<br/ ><br />A majority of the current code was developed as part of my Senior Project in conjunction with my friend Tyler Scott. This teamwork was a great benefit to the development as well as in learning the value of paired programming."
