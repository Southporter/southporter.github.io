I am building the webpage, server, and mobile apps for the business.<br />For the website, I am using ReactJS as the view, Reflux for the controller, and PHP with MySQL for the model.<br />As I do not have a Macintosh on which to work, I am currently only developing the mobile application for Android using AndroidStudio and Java.<br />While this is still a work in progress, I have learned a great deal about web development because of this project."
